- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), a clean, neutral Swiss-style typeface with slightly increased letter-spacing to enhance readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Abstract and minimalistic visual metaphors, rendered with thin gold lines (similar to antique engravings), instead of typical icons.

- Subtle, smooth transitions between sections, using fades and parallax scrolling to enhance the sense of depth and immersion.
